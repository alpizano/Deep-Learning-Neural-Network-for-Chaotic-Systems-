# Deep Learning Neural Network for Chaotic Systems 

# Introduction
Hiya, this will be a guide for my senior design project that spans two semesters (Senior Design I [Spring 2019] and Senior Design II[Fall 2019]) at Purdue University - Northwest. This project involved designing and developing a neural network that would localize, object detect and predict an outcome of where a ball would land in a roulette wheel.
